# Alias The Game

---

#### This app represents my implementation of one of my personal favourites when it comes to board games "Alias" or "Say Another Way". Main goal of this intellectual game is to get points by explaining words that are written on the cards.

You can do so by dividing into teams and giving them names. Then you will have to choose the difficulty of the game and tweak some settings, which will define the way you'll play the game. Teams take turns on explaining words in given time period. The idea is to explain them using synonyms, opposites or clues so that your team mates guess as many words from the cards as possible before the time runs out. The team gets same amount of points as words guessed.

# Functions:

##### 1) Team Management.

Friends can define number of teams and set their names according to their preferences.

##### 2) Three Difficulty Levels and Word Set Management.

Three dictionaries were specificly parsed from different word generation sites _(see the [AliasDictionaries](https://github.com/KirillJab/ITandDDP/tree/Lab2/AliasTheGame/AliasDictionaries) project folder for details)_. Words will be fetched from an improvised API.

##### 3) Game Settings.

You can deside how much time the round should go, how many words (AKA points) a team should get to win and should the last word be explained to all teams.

##### 4) Intense Game Process.

Swipe gesture word control, page with stats after each team finish their explanation where word status can be changed if it was set incorrectly.

##### 5) Visualisation of Progress

Each team will see their progress on the table after each every turn. And when you win all the other teams would know it!

##### 6) Haven't Finished the Game in One Go? No need to worry!

We got you covered with the ability to save and continue the game any time you want!
